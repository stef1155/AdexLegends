        <p>Adex Legends is a hero-based battle royale game developed by Respawn Entertainment. This game was initially published for Windows PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in February 2019. Only 10 nations, including Indonesia, have received early access to the mobile edition of Adex Legends. Every hero, or legend, has a distinct narrative to tell, as well as remarkable and unique powers.

            Arenas is a persistent game option in Apex Legends that pits you and your friends against a single opposing squad in round-based warfare. Arena matches take place on smaller terrain, resulting in tense 3v3 combat in which your side must win three rounds with a two-round margin.
            <br>
        <br>
        The accessible maps in the battle royale mode is currently Dessert Town.The TPP and FPP modes must be enabled at the start of the game, and the ranked match will begin at level eight. Users will be divided into three-person squads to play. There are 60 players in total, separated into 20 squads with no solo or pair choices, who all descend to the same map, loot, and shoot until only one team remains. Each person will have to choose between 10 legends and if ur squad already locked their legend, then the legend they are using will not be allowed to be picked again because of a duplication legend in a sthree-person squad. After picking a legend, jump from a blimp to get loot and survive until last squad standing.
        <br>
        <br>
        Overall, it's a battle royale game where three-person squad chooses each legend with a strategy in mind and their goal is to win above everyone else no matter what the game mode is.
